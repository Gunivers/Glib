## üì¶ Bookshelf - 2.2.0

```{epigraph}
**ü™ê The dimensional update!**

*This release features new modules for random distribution and terrain generation, refinements to existing modules, performance enhancements, and minor bug resolutions. Additionally, this update aims to ensure all functions work seamlessly across all dimensions.*
```

Bookshelf is now based on **Minecraft 1.21.3**.

### üéâ Added modules

- **[#1](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/1)** / **[#220](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/220)** Added the `bs.random` module, which includes:
  - Random distributions: uniform, binomial, geometric, and Poisson.
  - Noise generation functions: white, simplex, and fractal.
  - Random selection of an element from a list.
- **[#6](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/6)** Added the `bs.generate` module for terrain generation. Currently supports 2D shape algorithms, enabling texture and heightmap-based terrain generation.
- **[#193](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/193)** Added the `bs.interaction` module, which proposes interactions to listen to different players' events: left click, right click, hover (enter, leave and continuous).

### ‚ú® Added features

- **[#222](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/222)** Added `#bs.block:fill_random` for filling regions with randomly selected blocks.
- **[#258](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/258)** Added `#bs.block:emit_block_particle` to emit block particles in specific locations.
- **[#245](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/245)** Added `piercing` and callback options to `#bs.raycast:run`.
- **[#203](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/203)** Added `#bs.hitbox:is_entity_in_block` and `#bs.hitbox:is_entity_in_blocks` to verify if an entity is within a block.
- **[#233](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/233)** Introduced new link management functions:
  - `#bs.link:remove_link` to remove specific links.
  - `#bs.link:as_children`, `#bs.link:as_parent`, `#bs.link:at_children`, and `#bs.link:at_parent` to handle parent-child link relationships.
- **[#171](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/171)** Added logging functions `#bs.log:history` and `#bs.log:clear_history` for viewing and clearing log history.

### üîÅ Tweaks

- **[#251](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/251)** Enhanced `bs.block` fill functions to accept `from` and `to` inputs as either `[x, y, z]` lists or as stringified coordinates (e.g., `~ ~5 25`).
- **[#247](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/247)** Improved the default `bs.log` format for clarity.
- **[#252](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/252)** Optimized `bs.hitbox` module for improved performance.
- **[#265](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/265)** Optimized `bs.schedule` module for improved performance.
- **[#265](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/265)** Enabled `bs.move` module to function effectively at higher coordinate ranges. Collision detection has also been improved and should be more robust.
- **[#265](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/265)** Load tags do not load modules in isolation anymore. This can now be done using the `exclusive_load` tag.
- **[#276](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/276)** Add new hitboxes (new babies and salmon variants).

### üêõ Fixes

- **[#254](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/254)** Resolved execution loop interruptions caused by `#bs.schedule:schedule` callbacks.
- **[#243](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/243)** Fixed unload functions for `bs.health` and `bs.move`.
- **[#264](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/264)** Resolved compatibility issues with the schedule module outside the overworld.
- **[#255](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/255)** Fixed `bs.move` local velocity collisions.
- **[#262](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/262)** Resolved collision issues with paintings for `bs.raycast` and `bs.move`.
- **[#256](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/256)** Fixed XP progress boundary issues at 0% and 100%.
- **[#265](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/pull/265)** Corrected hitbox for player in spectator mode.
- **[#270](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/Bookshelf/issues/270)** Enabled all modules to function across any dimension.
