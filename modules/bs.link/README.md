## üî• Motivation

As developers, we understand the value of libraries: they save time, streamline workflows, and eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel. However, we‚Äôve noticed that many mapmakers in the Minecraft community are less familiar with this concept.

That‚Äôs why we started this project, to provide a variety of reusable tools and encourage mapmakers to embrace the use of libraries.

While we strive to keep our modules as optimized as possible, our top priority is accessibility. We focus on creating features that are easy to use and simple to install, ensuring they‚Äôre practical for everyone.
